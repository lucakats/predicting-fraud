# predicting-fraud

In this repository you will find my second SAS project completed through post-grad study as an individual task. The assignment asked we used our newly acquired knowledge of SAS create models to predict accounting fraud. We first prepared the data, then performed some basic statistics and logistic regressions, and finally created models and backtested these models to determine their accuracy.

This repo includes the final PDF, as well as a .Txt file with the corresponding SAS code used to feed the report's findings.

SAS code was written in SAS Studio (SAS OnDemand for Academics - included in post-grad study)
